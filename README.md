Train control simulator

This is a simulation of the Automatic Train Control simulator, with added features:
 - It links to the IOS code reference.
 - It will hopefully work as an obstruction plan tool.
 - It doesn't take 1-3 hours to start up.
 - It doesn't crash frequently.
 - It is online and can be available on any computer.

I am a new programmer and this is my first major project. I have been learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS while working on this.

There are a lot of features I still hope to add, and a lot of work still to do.
